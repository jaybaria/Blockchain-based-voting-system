# FAQ 


## [What is the Blockchain ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
> A blockchain,originally block chain,is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.
>Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).


##  Why blockchain is emerging ? 
>The blockchain is for authorizing payments of a cryptocurrency between two peers without the need for a centralized 3rd party approving of the transaction. There are other uses of the blockchain which are more in line with the second point, digital signatures, but they are secondary to the main purpose of peer to peer transfer of value.

## what is Ganche?
>Ganache is an ethereum client which one can use for Ethereum development. Ganache is part of Truffle ecosystem. You can use ganache for the development of DAPP(Decentralised-Application) and once it is developed and tested on the ganache you can deploy your DAPP on ethereum client like geth or parity.

## [what is metamsk?](https://medium.com/@seanschoi/what-is-metamask-really-what-is-it-7bc1bf48c75)
>MetaMask allows users to manage accounts and their keys in a variety of ways, including hardware wallets, while isolating them from the site context. This is a great security improvement over storing the user keys on a single central server, or even in local storage, which can allow for mass account thefts.
